# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview:
Credit risk is very tough to predict. In this project we want to take a look at how all the factors in our loan_stats csv help predict whether someone is low or high risk status. The purpose of this analysis was to create a supervised machine learning model that could accurately predict credit risk. In order to complete this task, I used 6 different methods, which are:

1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. SMOTE Oversampling
3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4. SMOTEENN Sampling
5. Balanced Random Forest Classifying
6. Easy Ensemble Classifying

Through each of these methods, I split my data into training and testing datasets, and compiled accuracy scores, confusion matries, and classification reports as my results.

## Resources:
- **Data Source:** LoanStats_2019Q1.csv
- **Software:** Jupyter Notebook, Anaconda Navigator
- **Languages:** Python
